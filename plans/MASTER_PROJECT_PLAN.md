## Key Features

### Must Have (MVP)
1. Display top 10 JRPG games
2. Voting system (upvote/downvote)
3. Real-time ranking updates
4. Responsive design
5. Game detail pages
6. Session-based vote limiting

### Nice to Have
1. User accounts
2. Comments and reviews
3. Social sharing
4. Advanced filtering
5. Vote history
6. Admin panel
7. API for external access

## Technical Decisions

### Database Schema
```typescript
// Game Model
interface Game {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  releaseYear: number;
  developer: string;
  publisher: string;
  platforms: string[];
  coverImageUrl: string;
  description: string;
  votes: number;
  rank: number;
}

// Vote Model
interface Vote {
  id: string;
  gameId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  userId?: string;
  voteType: 'up' | 'down';
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Component Structure
- `GameCard` - Display individual game with voting
- `RankingList` - Show ordered list of games
- `VoteButton` - Interactive voting component
- `GameDetail` - Full game information page
- `Header/Footer` - Site navigation
- `LoadingStates` - Skeleton screens

### API Routes
- `GET /api/games` - Fetch all games
- `GET /api/games/[id]` - Get game details
- `POST /api/games/[id]/vote` - Submit vote
- `GET /api/rankings` - Get current rankings

## Success Metrics
1. Page load time < 3 seconds
2. Time to Interactive < 5 seconds
3. Mobile responsiveness score > 95
4. Zero runtime errors in production
5. 99.9% uptime
6. User engagement (votes per session)

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Vote manipulation**: Implement rate limiting and session tracking
2. **Performance issues**: Use Next.js ISR and caching
3. **Database scaling**: Start with Vercel KV, migrate if needed
4. **Cost overruns**: Monitor Vercel usage, set alerts
5. **Security**: Regular audits, input validation
